# ruby-calculator
An on-terminal calculator made using Ruby.
Unlike other calculators I've made, this one has the ability to store
variables with values, either an int or float. 

The result of the `calc` operation will the stored in the default built-in
`ans` variable, which can is a valid input.

When prompted for an input, for the `calc` or `var` operation which
requires a value, simply enter a number or valid existing variable
name.
